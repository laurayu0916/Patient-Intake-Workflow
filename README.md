## Project 1: Ploty Dashborad Visualization for Patient Waiting Days

**Toolkit:** Plotly/Dash, Bootstrap

**Goal:** Improve patient satisfaction and optimize the patient intake workflow by reducing patient waiting days. 

**Steps:**

1. Calculate and Visualize the waiting days for each step during the international patient intake workflow. 
2. Investigate the relationship between waiting days and inquery-to-patient conversion rate.
3. Identify the bottlenecks in the workflow.

**Business Use Case:** Once we identify the bottlenecks in our workflow, i.e. steps with high average waiting days, high standard deviations and are highly correlated to the conversion rate, we would propose recommendations to help reduce waiting days.
